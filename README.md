# Subsurface-Scattering-for-Unity-URP
A simple shader graph subgraph that creates a subsurface scattering like effect. 
Relatively performant, theoretically should work fine on mobile, and easy to use in your own shaders. 

Also included is a premade shader using this subgraph, so if you dont know how to use shader graph you can just use that.

It uses the scenes main light primarily - additional lights will not create scattering effect.
